# my-repo
Personal repository for learning and development

Hello! This is, as the name suggests, my personal repo. 

1. I don't have a well developed plan at the moment on how this will be organized or what it will contain.
2. Comments and criticism are welcome! I am learning after all.
3. I need to think of more interesting nomenclature.
